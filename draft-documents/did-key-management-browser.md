# DID Key Management in the Browser

By Alberto Elias, Andr√© Cruz, Joao Santos and Marton Csernai

## Abstract

There are many projects implementing DIDs, and different DID methods, in many different ways. This paper examines the specific requirements for the Web and browsers. The Web has a different security model than native platforms (e.g. mobile apps) and even, limited access to native device capabilities (e.g secure cryptoprocessor chips). We explore these limitations and how they apply to DID key management including, but not limited to, authentication, signing, key storage, key recovery, synchronization across multiple devices and user experience.
