# Objectives
- p2p DIDs are transactional - they may be used for one or more transaction between parties.
- p2p did communication/resolution does not require a Universal Resolver - documents are self contained in a message protocol.
- p2p did exchange is for the purposes of establishing secure communication, but Trust in the peers must be established at another level step (in person, out of band, using Verifiable Credentials, using other attestations)
- p2p DIDs communication / protocol is not bound to any specific ledger based DID service or design model
- p2p DIDs are interoperable with Ledger (anchored) backed DIDs; the ‘anchored’ DID documents can be exchanged over this methodology and treated as ‘peer’. 
- create an n-wise peer DID spec - of which a use case is pairwise DID exchange.

# Use Cases

Two or more individuals can create DIDs “without any overhead”: infrastructure, registry costs, or time penalty, or even network requirement.

Two service entities wish to communicate in an ‘anonymous but trusted’ way for a data exchange transaction, but do not need this relationship persisted beyond the transaction lifetime.

In a doctor, hospital, patient context
